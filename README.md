# Movies-ETL
## Overview: 
### The goal of this project was to create a database for Amazing Prime's Hack-a-thon by using web-based databases and using the extraction, translate, and load paradigm to create clean and usable data.
## Purpose: 
### Using Jupyter Notebook, PgAdmin, and Web-based databases we will create the data sets for Amazing Prime to use in their Hack-a-thon that will help them identify an algorithm that can predict which low-budget film will be a success. 
---
# Results: 
## Overall we were able to narrow down our data to two databases composed of;
### 6200+ Movies
### 26 million rating results for each movie.
## Our work was able to deduce the ratings specific to the 6200+ movies. Our team fills confident this should provide plenty of data to help create a strong algorithm to help Amazing Prime.
